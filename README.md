## What is it/Inspiration

YearView is a safe photo storage tool that lets you keep track of your pictures and reflect on the memories you've made over the course of the year.

Have you ever looked back and said to yourself, "Damn, New Years was just last week," just to wake up and realise it's already May?! What happened in between??Â Through YearView, you'll be able to see what you've done over the months to know only how far you've achieved!

## Features

- Add images one by one or in bulk, with various file formats such as png and jpg
- Delete pictures
- Search/filter pictures by common characteristics
- Securly upload/delete pictures
- A month view that allows you to see all of the photos you've uploaded in each month
- Secure Login/Account Creation mechanism (only you can see your pictures)

|/signup  | Page where user can create an account and set up their username, password and name |
|/check   | Once user enters login credentials, they get tested with the data in Mongo to ensure the correct person is accessing this account|

## Tools

- Python/Flask (Server)
- MongoDB (Server)
- HTML/CSS/JS (Client)

## Usage (Examples)

This is a simple mechanism for creating an account and logging in:

- Passwords are 64-bit encrpyted
- Many edge cases are considered such as if the confirm password doesn't match the entered password, if the username is already taken, if a wrong password is entered, etc.

This is how a user can upload pictures and view the certain pictures they added in a specific month

- Each image is linked to a secure key, meaning that it can be uploaded, retrieved, and deleted safely
- When storing huge numbers of images, images can be uploaded in bulk, saving time
- Users will be able to go back in time and see what they did in each month in order to relive happy memories
- The color of the month gets brighter depending on the amount of images uploaded

Users may also sort photographs by the category they assigned to them

When you click on an item, you'll be able to see details like the description, type, and date it was added. You'll also be able to remove the image from the archive as well

1. Git clone this repo onto your local (i.e copy the following into your command prompt)

2. Run the following to install all dependencies:

        pip install -r requirements.txt
        
3. Create an account on [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try) and make a new DB and copy the Mongo Connection String
4. Traverse to app.py and place the connection you got into here:

        app.config['MONGO_URI'] = 'YOUR CONNECTION STRING + &ssl=true&ssl_cert_reqs=CERT_NONE'

5. Start the app by running "flask run" and go to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/) on your browser
6. Enjoy! 

## Testing/Security

Unit tests are contained within the app_tests.py and monthblock_tests.py files and for security as mentioned before, all passwords are encrypted rather than stored as plain text. Additionally, as photos are posted, they are assigned a special key that only belongs to them, making it impossible for outsiders to locate them. Only registered users with access to an account can view or remove their photos.
